# The basic idea is an automated network controller.
# The starting idea is to use python to create all the neccessary data and library's.
# The project should at the end present a GUI or a frontend in a local web page to see/handle/operate everything.

----------IDEA BREAK DOWN----------
* Be able to controll your computer to the fullest including things like processes, ports, services, logs.
* Be able to powershoot problems from layer 5 to layer 2.
* Be able to see everything including filesystem, networking, etc..

* Be able to see all the other devices in your LAN including the most data available about them.
* Be able to controll/controll the other devices to the level desired and capable
* Be able to penetrate yourself and other devices in your LAN.

----------IDEA---------
* Create everything as objects
* Create a library for every part of the project
* Create a modulary code

* More specific: Create an executer that can run shell code
* More specific: Create a package for windows and linux to represent a computer
* More specific: Create a package for nmap

*** Maybe: Be able to try to log to other computers and run a function like 'get_computer_details' and share this data
amongst PC's in an encrypted way OR just keep it simple (use the nmap scanner to get details)


----------RISKY----------
* Create a new protocol to share the data between computers
* Maybe make it possible so that ONE computer could be shared across multiple physical PC's
* Automate pen-testing process

----------IMPORTANT----------
* Make it as modular as possible so you can do everything you want with it:
Scan/Handle/Share the network
